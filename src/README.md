SportsLover Team265

You can use http://138.197.19.37/ or https://138.197.19.37/ for reviewing

It supports at least safari, firefox, and chrome.

If you are using chrome, we recommend you to use https://138.197.19.37/ because in the website we used getCurrentLocation.js on Google Map API for fetching the current location. Since now in chrome this method only support in https, so if you use http, the "nearby sports place" function would be invalid.
